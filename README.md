OCTAV3

# What is it?

OCTAV3 is a decentralized music streaming platform that connects artists, listeners and advertisers. We are building a web3 enabled ad engine to create a fairer relationship between all three stakeholders.

# How it’s made

- Built with Zora, Polygon and nft.storage (IPFS):

**Front-end:**

- Client built on Next.js with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS and Ant Design to design components
- Ethers.js for front-end interaction with smart contracts
- WalletConnect and Web3Modal to connect to Evmos testnet

**Back-end:**
- https://github.com/meta-web3-music/smart-contracts
- We used Zora’s contracts to allow artists to mint/transfer a song NFT and an advertisement NFT
- All contracts are deployed on Polygon Mumbai testnet
- All the data (i.e. ad images) and metadata is stored and queryable on IPFS through nft.storage

## How to use OCTAV3

- Sign into OCTAVE3 with your favorite wallet (MetaMask, Ledger Live)
- To mint an NFT, navigate to home screen, then click “Mint Song NFT” button. A modal will open, and you can set your NFT’s data there and set ad space price
- To advertise on the platform, click the “Ad marketplace” button in the header. Here you’ll have the option to rent ad space on a song of your choice
